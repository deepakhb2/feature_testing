## Specification

Let’s write down our user stories first.

This way we can focus on them, and figure out the implementation later. Also, we’ll know exactly how much work we still have in front of us.

* Listing all members: When I go to the members list then I want to see a list of all members, linking to their details page, and links to edit and remove the member.
* Showing member details: When I go to the members list, and I click on a member name, then I want the member’s details page to be shown, displaying their name.
* Creating a new member: When I go to the members list, click the link “New member”, fill in the name, and click submit, then I want the member details page for this new member to be shown, with a confirmation message.
* Editing a member: When I go to the members list, click the “Edit” link for a member, change their name, and click submit, then I want the member details page for this member to be shown, displaying their new name, with a confirmation message.
* Removing a member: When I go to the members list, click the “Remove” link for a member, and confirm, then I want the members list to be shown, with the member removed, and a confirmation message.
